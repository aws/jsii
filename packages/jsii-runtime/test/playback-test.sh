# will record all kernel inputs (">") and outputs ("<") into a log file.
#
# Then, we take each one of these log files and extract only the inputs (lines that begin with ">").
# We then execute jsii-runtime and pipe these inputs via STDIN.
#
# jsii-runtime emits the same logging format (inputs and outputs) to STDERR, so we capture
# these lines and then diff them with the expected file to validate.

# If the outputs are the same the test passed.
