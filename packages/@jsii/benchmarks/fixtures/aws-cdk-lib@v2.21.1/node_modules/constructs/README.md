## What are constructs?

Constructs are classes which define a "piece of system state". Constructs can be composed together to form higher-level building blocks which represent more complex state.

Constructs are often used to represent the _desired state_ of cloud applications. For example, in the AWS CDK, which is used to define the desired state for AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation, the lowest-level construct represents a _resource definition_ in a CloudFormation template. These resources are composed to represent higher-level logical units of a cloud application, etc.
