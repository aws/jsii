This is the JSII runtime for go. This repository is used only for publishing the go module. The source code is managed in [the main JSII repository](https://github.com/aws/jsii). Refer to the [go-runtime readme there](https://github.com/aws/jsii/blob/main/packages/%40jsii/go-runtime/README.md) for details on building and testing the module.
