 * For now, model a toposorted list as a list of tranches.

 * C depends-on A, and we sort to:
 *
 *    [[A, B], [C]]
 *
 * Now, let's say A finishes quickly and B takes a long time: we still have
 * to wait for B to finish before we could start C in this modeling.
 *
 * The better alternative would be to model a class that keeps the dependency
 * graph and unlocks nodes as we go through them. That's a lot of effort
 * for now, so we don't do that yet.
 *
 * We do declare the type `Toposorted<A>` here so that if we ever change
 * the type, we can find all usage sites quickly.
