!!! info "The following node releases are part of our test matrix:"

    | Release   | Status                       | End-of-Life  |
    | --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
    | `^14.6.0` | :white_check_mark: Supported | `2023-04-30` |
    | `^16.3.0` | :white_check_mark: Supported | `2024-09-11` |
    | `^18.0.0` | :white_check_mark: Supported | `2025-04-30` |

    ??? question "Status Definitions"
        - **:white_check_mark: Supported**: Long Term Support (LTS) releases  (those with an even major version) are
          supported and bugs specific to those releases are addressed with the highest priority. Every `jsii` release is
          automatically tested against those releases.
        - **:test_tube: Best effort**: Development releases (those with an odd major version) are supported on a
          best-effort basis. Some of these releases may include breaking changes or bugs that may cause runtime errors
          that we may not be able to fix.

    Releases not in the matrix might work, but are not guaranteed to: they can be considered to fall under the
    **:test_tube: Best Effort** umbrella, unless they are end-of-life. Releases past end-of-life are unlikely to work,
    or may stop working with any future release.

    The [node releases schedule][node-releases] provides up-to-date information on the current status of all active
    releases, and indicates the timelines for support (including planned End-of-Life dates for each).
