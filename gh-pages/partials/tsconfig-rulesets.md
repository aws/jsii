| `strict` :star:     | (Default) Validates the provided config against a strict rule set designed for widespread support and backwards-compatibility.                                                            |
| `generated`         | Enforces a tsconfig as if it were generated by jsii. Use this to stay compatible with the generated config, but have full ownership over the file.                                        |
| `minimal` :warning: | Only reject options that are known to be incompatible with jsii. This rule set is likely to be incomplete and new rules will be added without notice as incompatibilities are discovered. |
| `off` :warning:     | Disables all config validation, including options that are known to be incompatible with jsii. Intended for experimentation only. Use at your own risk.                                   |

:warning: Resulting jsii assembly/package may be incompatible with wider ecosystem

There is currently no easy way to inspect these rule sets, however detailed error messages are returned if a provided tsconfig fails validation.
