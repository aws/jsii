# Introduction

This section of the *jsii reference* contains user-guides for different
audiences. The below sections provide an overview of each section.

## Library author guide

The [library author guide](./lib-author) provides information to developers who
want to use the [jsii toolchain] to author libraries that will be usable from
all supported programming languages.

It contains important information on [TypeScript restrictions], as well as the
language binding [configuration reference].


## Library consumer guide

The [library consumer guide](./lib-user) provides specific information
intended for developers leveraging libraries generated by the [jsii toolchain].
In particular, it provides guidance for how to correctly use those libraries, in
cases where the generated bindings are somewhat non-idiomatic.

## Language implementation guide

The [language implementation guide](./language-support) provides
information to developers who are interested in contributing support for a new
language in the [jsii toolchain].

[configuration reference]: ./lib-author/configuration
