## :fontawesome-brands-node-js: Common Runtime

Regardless of which language or platform your application is developed in, using *jsii modules* requires a compatible
`node` runtime to be available in `$PATH`(see [Runtime Architecture]). Current `node` runtime versions support status is
as follows:

--8<-- "partials/node-support-table.md"

## Specific Runtimes

For specific languages, these are the minimum runtime versions that are supported by the `jsii` toolchain:

| Runtime | Version |
|---------|---------|
| .NET    | 6.0     |
| Java    | 8       |
| Go      | 1.23    |
| Python  | 3.9     |
