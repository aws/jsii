# TypeScript Restrictions

Since the API exported by *jsii modules* will be represented in a variety of other languages, certain restrictions are
enforced by the `jsii` compiler.

!!! info
    Since those restrictions are solely intended to ensure the exported API can be represented in other languages, they
    do not apply to any internal declarations such as `#!ts private` members and declarations annotated with the
    `#!ts /** @internal */` tag.

## Dependencies

A *jsii module* can declare dependencies on any other *jsii module* by adding entries in the `dependencies` key in the
`package.json` file. Since most other platforms do not support multiple different versions of the same library to
coexist in the same closure, it is recommended to also declare all such dependencies as `peerDependencies`.

Occasionally, a dependency on a *non-jsii module* is useful. Since such dependencies do not have generated bindings in
all the supported languages, they must be bundled with the *jsii module* that depends on them, by adding the library
into the `bundleDependencies` array in `package.json`. The API of the *jsii module* can not expose any type from bundled
dependencies, since those types would not be available in other languages.

!!! info
    For more information on `package.json` file contents, refer to the [npm documentation][package-json].

## Naming

### Class Members

Members of *classes* cannot share the same *PascalCased* representation as the declaring *class* itself, as this results
in invalid **C#** code:

```ts hl_lines="2-3 7-8"
export class Foo {
  // ðŸ’¥ Illegal property name
  public foo: string;
}

export class Bar {
  // ðŸ’¥ Illegal method name
  public bar(): void { /* ... */ }
}
```

!!! danger
    Due to existing usage, this restriction is only enforced when `jsii` is invoked with the `--strict` option. The
    generated **C#** class name will receive a `_` suffix if any of it's members conflict, which is a breaking change to
    existing **.NET** consumers when a conflicting member is introduced after the initial release.

### Interfaces

The `jsii` type model distinguishes two kinds of *interfaces*:

- *Behavioral interfaces*, which can declare methods and properties
- *Structs*, which are immutable pure data entities, and can consequently only declare `#!ts readonly` properties

A name convention is used to distinguish between these two: *behavioral interfaces* must have a name that starts with a
`I` prefix, while *structs* must not have such a prefix.

```ts hl_lines="5-8"
/**
 * Since there is no `I` prefix, Foo is considered to be a struct.
 */
export interface Foo {
  // ðŸ’¥ Structs are not allowed to declare methods
  foo(): void;
  // ðŸ’¥ Structs are not allowed to declare mutable properties
  mutableProperty: number;
  // âœ… Structs can declare immutable properties
  readonly immutableProperty: string;
}

/**
 * Since there is an `I` prefix, IFoo is considered to be a behavioral interface.
 */
export interface IFoo {
  // âœ… Behavioral interfaces can declare methods
  foo(): void;
  // âœ… Behavioral interfaces can declare mutable properties
  mutableProperty: number;
  // âœ… Behavioral interfaces can declare immutable properties
  readonly immutableProperty: string;
}
```

## Inheritance

### Structs

As *structs* are pure data entities, they can only be extended by other *structs*:

```ts hl_lines="3-4 6-7"
export interface Struct { /* ...readonly properties... */ }

// ðŸ’¥ Structs cannot be extended by behavioral interfaces
export interface IBehavioralInterface extends Struct { /* ... */ }

// ðŸ’¥ Structs cannot be implemented by classes
export class ConcreteType implements Struct { /* ... */ }

// âœ… Structs can extend other structs
export interface SuperStruct extends Struct { /* ...readonly properties */ }
```

### Member Visibility

The **C#** language does not allow overriding members to change the visibility of the overridden declaration, even if
the updated visibility is more permissive. As a consequence, overridden members are required to retain the same
visibility as their parents.

!!! danger
    This makes changing the visibility of a `#!ts protected` member to `#!ts public` is a breaking change in `jsii`
    libraries!

```ts hl_lines="6-7"
export class Base {
  protected method(): void { /* ... */ }
}

export class Subclass extends Base {
  // ðŸ’¥ Illegal change of visibility from protected to public
  public method(): void { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Covariant Overrides & Parameter List Changes

In **TypeScript**, overriding members can have a signature that differs from the overridden member as long as the new
signature is compatible with the parent. This is however not supported as:

- **Java** and **C#** do not support omitting parameters when overriding or implementing a member
- **C#** does not support overriding or implementing a member using covariant parameter or return types

!!! note
    **C# 9** introduces support for covariant return types, which would allow relaxing this restriction, however `jsii`
    must build code targetting the `.NET Core 3.1` runtime, which only supports **C# 8**. Once `.NET Core 3.1` becimes
    end-of-life, this may change.

```ts hl_lines="6-7 9-10 12-13"
export class Base {
  public method(param: any): any { /* ... */ }
}

export class Child extends Base {
  // ðŸ’¥ Parameter signatures do not match
  public method(): any { /* ... */ }

  // ðŸ’¥ Parameter types do not match, even though they are covariant
  public method(param: string): any { /* ... */ }

  // ðŸ’¥ Return type does not match, even though it is covariant
  public method(param: any): string { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Parameterized Types (aka: Generics)

Parameterized types are not consistently supported in all supported target languages. **Go** does not currently support
generics, and the differences in generic semantics between **TypeScript**, **C#** and **Java** make it difficult to
correctly represent such types in all those languages. As a consequence, `jsii` does not support declaring parameterized
types.

Only certain *built-in* parameterized types can be used in `jsii` modules:
- `Array<T>`, which is equivalent to `T[]`
- `Record<string, T>`, which is equivalent to `{ [key: string]: T }`
- `Promise<T>`, which is the return type of any *asynchronous* method

```ts hl_lines="1-4"
// ðŸ’¥ Parameterized types cannot be introduced
export interface Parameterized<T> {
  readonly value: T;
}

export interface IAsyncFooMaker {
  // âœ… Asynchronous methods must return promises
  makeFoo(): Promise<Foo>;
  // âœ… Arrays are supported
  makeFoos(count: number): Array<Promise<Foo>>;
}
```

# Soft-Reserved Words

In order to guarantee a consistent developer experience across all supported languages, `jsii` emits warnings whenever
a declaration is named after any target language's *reserved words*, as those will need renaming in target languages:
