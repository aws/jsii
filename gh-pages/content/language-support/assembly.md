# `.jsii` Assemblies

This document describes the contents of the `.jsii` assembly documents generated by the `jsii` compiler, and explains
the semantics behind the various entities it represents. This serves as a reference for front-end language implementors.

## Schema

`.jsii` assemblies are JSON-formatted documents. The specification is hosted under the [`jsii-spec`][jsii-spec] package.
Refer to the inline documentation in the [`spec.ts`][spec.ts] file for more information about the general content of the
assembly documents.

The most important part of the assembly documentation, which is described in detail in this document, is the `types`
map, which contains the descriptions of all types declared by the `.jsii` assembly. It is a map from `jsii` fully-
qualified type names to a type specification.

All `boolean` attributes in the document specification are optional, and are left out (`undefined`) when `false`.

### Common Attributes

Certain optional attributes are shared by API entities (types and members):

- `docs` - documentation attached to the API entity
  - `deprecated` - contains a message explaining why an API was deprecated and/or how users should migrate away
  - `stability` - the stability level of the API entity. The ultimate meaning of the stability level is up to the
    package maintainer, but a baseline interpretation of the valid values follows:
    - `experimental` denotes an API that is actively worked on and are not subject to semantic versioning gurantees
      (they may receive breaking change on a _minor_ version release)
    - `stable` denotes an API that is safe to use in production systems and are subject ot semantic versioning
      guarantees (they may not receive breaking changes without a _major_ version bump)
    - `deprecated` denotes an API that should no longer be used. The `deprecated` entry in the `docs` object should
      contain a message explaining how users should migrate away
    - `external` denotes an API that is not owned by the package's maintainer and may change in unexpected ways. Such
      APIs are usually derived from external artifacts, which the package maintainers do not have control over.
  - additional entries represent user-defined `JSDoc` tags with meaning defined by convention and/or the package
    maintainer
- `locationInModule` - coordinates of the declaration in the source
  - `fileName` - the path to the source file, relative to the package root
  - `line` - the line number on which the entity is declared (or the first line when a declaration spans multiple lines)

#### Interfaces

`jsii` interfaces are declarations of type signatures that can be implemented by classes. _Interface_ names must be
prefixed with an `I` (e.g: `IFoo`).

| Attribute    | Type          | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kind`       | `'interface'` | Discriminator to identify interfaces                               |
| `assembly`   | `string`      | The name of the assembly this interface is a part of               |
| `fqn`        | `string`      | The fully-qualified name of the interface                          |
| `interfaces` | `string[]`    | The fully-qualified names of interfaces extended by this interface |
| `methods`    | `Method[]`    | The [methods] declared by this interface                           |
| `name`       | `string`      | The simple name of the interface                                   |
| `properties` | `Property[]`  | The [properties] declared by this interface                        |

#### Structs (a.k.a. Data Types)

_Structs_ (or _Data Types_) are immutable, data-only interfaces:

- They declare no methods
- All [properties] they declare are `readonly`
- They can only implement other _structs_
- They cannot be extended by interfaces that are not _structs_
- They cannot be implemented by _classes_

Unlike regular _interfaces_, `jsii` _struct_ names are not required to have any particular prefix.

Since those are immutable, pure data objects, the `jsii-runtime` exchanges instances of those _by value_, instead of _by
reference_, allowing to save cross-language communication overhead when working with the data.

| Attribute    | Type          | Description                                                     |

| `datatype`   | `true`        | Indicates a _struct_ / _data type_ declaration                  |
| `assembly`   | `string`      | The name of the assembly this struct is a part of               |
| `fqn`        | `string`      | The fully-qualified name of the struct                          |
| `interfaces` | `string[]`    | The fully-qualified names of _struct_ extended by this _struct_ |
| `name`       | `string`      | The simple name of the struct                                   |

| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abstract`   | `boolean`       | Whether this method is `abstract`                                                   |
| `async`      | `boolean`       | Whether this method is asynchronous                                                 |
| `name`       | `string`        | The name of the method                                                              |

| `protected`  | `boolean`       | Whether this method is protected                                                    |

Methods with the `abstract` feature may only be members of `abstract` classes or [interfaces], and all methods that are
members of [interfaces] must be `abstract`.

Methods that are `static` cannot feature the `overrides` attribute, as `static` members are not inherited.

#### Properties

| Attribute   | Type            | Description                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abstract`  | `boolean`       | Whether this property is `abstract`                                                   |
| `const`     | `boolean`       | Whether this property is a constant (implies `static` and `immutable`)                |
| `immutable` | `boolean`       | Whether this property is immutable                                                    |
| `name`      | `string`        | The name of the property                                                              |
| `optional`  | `boolean`       | Whether this property is optional                                                     |
| `overrides` | `string`        | The fully-qualified name of the class/interface that declares the overridden property |
| `protected` | `boolean`       | Whether this constructor is protected                                                 |
| `static`    | `boolean`       | Whether this property is `static`                                                     |
| `type`      | `TypeReference` | The type of the property                                                              |

Properties that are `const` must have a `name` that is `UPPER_SNAKE_CASED`. They represent constants similar to [Enum
Members], which can be proactively resolved by the `jsii` runtimes.

!!! danger
    Properties and methods that are `static` **can** feature the `overrides` attribute, as `static` members are
    inherited with the prototype in **JavaScript** (as part of the ES6 specification). Not all target languages have
    this capability (most, like **C#** and **Java**, only support *hiding* static declarations), and consequently code
    generators may ignore this (or explicitly hide parent declarations) instead.
