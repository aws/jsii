# Format

So you want to add a new Architecture Decision Record to this section. This
document highlights how to proceed in order to achieve a consistent look and
feel, and that we capture sufficient information.

## Create a new document

Each ADR document should be named using the following format:
`YYYY-MM-DD-short-name.md`. This allows ensuring the documents are rendered in
the correct order on the website. If is recommended to prefix the file name
with the date at which the decision has been made, in ISO-8601 format.

## Template

The following template is to be used:
