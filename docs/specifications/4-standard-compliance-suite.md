# Standard Compliance Suite

## Goal
The goal of the standard compliance suite is to be a normative description of
the behaviors that all language runtime implementations (*host runtime library*
in combination with *code generation*) must implement. This description takes
the form of a collection of test cases that must be re-implemented in each
*host* language, so that compliance can be asserted.

Since the goal of *jsii* is to expose a single Object-Oriented API to multiple
programming languages, it is important to ensure the behavior is consistent
across all of them. This can be achieved by making sure that the interactions
between the *host* and *kernel* processes are the same for a given use-case.

## Format
In order to assert whether a new runtime implementation is correct, a formal
compliance test suite is defined, that all language runtimes must fully
implement before they can be deemed eligible for General Availability.

This document describes these tests, as well as a general approach for ensuring
conformance requirements are met in a systematic manner.

### Categories
Test cases in the standard compliance suite are grouped by categories, which
help implementors direct their effort in the early stages of the implementation
of new language bindings. Each category is declared in an `H3` title (a line
that starts with `### `) within the [`## Test Suite`] title. A description of
the category immediately follows the opening title. The category ends with the
end of the document, or whenever another `H2` title is reached.

[`## Test Suite`]: #test-suite

### Test Case
Within a category title, test cases are delimited by `H4` (`#### `) titles,
which correspond to the test case name. The test case name should be kept
concise (dieally within 75 characters) and try to be as descriptive as possible.

Immediately after the `H4` title is an english language description of the test
case that explains the property the test is designed to validate in as much
detail as possible. As much as possible, test case descriptions should be
self-sufficient.

After the attributes table, a **TypeScript** block of code describes the
canonical form of the test. It includes any type declaration that is used by the
test (so the code example is self-contained). Assertions performed by the test
should be written in the form of [`jest`] expectations.

> :question: The assertion code is intended as a formal representation of the
> tests' normative procedure. It is not currently executed against the *kernel*,
> but this could be achieved in the future. Additionally, we might be able to
> automatically transliterate the tests to other languages using
> [`jsii-rosetta`].

[`jest`]: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started
[`jsii-rosetta`]: ../../../packages/jsii-rosetta

Finally, another code block details the sequence of messages that should be
exchanged between the *host* and `node` processes during the execution of the
test case, such that implementations can assert coherent behavior.

Initial messages corresponding to the `hello` and `load` calls can be omitted at
the beginning of the kernel trace. Those messages are typically identicall
across tests and there is little value in asserting around those. Any `load`
call happening after the first call that is neither the `hello` message or
another `load` call **must** however be included.

The dialogue is the sequence of JSON formatted messages, from the perspective of
the *host* app, using the following notation:

* Messages sent by the *host* runtime to the `node` process:
  ```
  > { "api": "foo" }
  ```
* Messages received by the *host* runtime from the `node` process:
  ```
  < { "result": "bar" }
  ```
* Comments to improve readability of the trace:
  ```
  # Comment continues until the end of the line
  ```
* Blank lines can be added to logically group trace elements

> :question: is there a need to support some form of a capture mechanism to
> provision for non-deterministric results, or non-normative elements such as
> the exact Object IDs issued for created instances?

Below is the template markdown to copy-paste when introducing a new test case in
the compliance suite. New tests should always be added at the very end of the
category they belong to, right after the last test in said category.

````md
### Test Category
#### Test Case Name

A short english language description of what property this test verifies. The
description should include enough detail for a reader to be able to understand
the test without having to search for any additional information. Prefer a long,
unambiguous description to a terse one that could be subject to interpretation.

<details><summary>Show test</summary>

##### Reference Implementation
```ts
// GIVEN
export class Foo { /* ... */ }

// WHEN
const bar = new Foo().bar();

// THEN
expect(bar.baz).toBeUndefined();
```

##### Reference Kernel Messaging
```
## You can omit the initial hello/load messages
# < { "hello": "@jsii/runtime@1.2.3" }
# > { "load": { "name": "test-case-001", "version": "1.2.3", "tarball": "/tmp/jsii-kernel-test/lib.tgz" } }
# < { "assembly": "test-case-001", "types": 3 }
```
</details>
````
</details>

## Compliance
In order to be able to assert compliance of language binding libraries to the
standard test suite, implementations are responsible for providing a test
harness (typically as part of the runtime library) that can produce a
standardized test report in the form of a JSON document that follows the
following schema:

```ts
interface TestReport {
  /** The report is broken down by test category, using the name as-is */
  [category: string]: {
    /** For each test in the category, using it's name as-is */
    [test: string]: {
      /** Whether the test passed or failed */
      status: 'PASS' | 'FAIL';
      /** The kernel messages captured during the test */
      kernelTrace: Array<KernelMessage>;
    };
  };
}

interface KernelMessage {
  /** The direction the message was sent (Host -> Kernel / Kernel -> Host) */
  direction: 'FromKernel' | 'ToKernel';
  /** The message, as a JSON object */
  message: { [key: string]: unknown };
}
```

The `@jsii/compliance` package provides the necessary tools to consume such a
test report, together with the Markdown document describing the compliance suite,
and procuces a report describing compliance test coverage as well as information
about any non-conformant test result.

> :construction: The `@jsii/compliance` tool does not exist yet.

> :question: Should a "somewhat standard" format such as XUnit test report be
> used instead of rolling our own JSON document?

## Test Suite

### Legacy
This section is due to contain all compliance tests that were implemented before
the *jsii specification* was initially written. They are going to be gradually
replaced by more focused tests with better descriptions.

#### Type Unions are correctly disambiguated by the Kernel
In certain cases, two or more types in a *Type Union* can overlap in such a way
that they are all valid structural types for the value. Statically typed
languages however will not be satisfied with structural typing only, and require
the correct declared type to be preserved.

// GIVEN
export interface BluePill {
  readonly offeredTo: string;
  readonly makesYouForgetTheMatrix?: boolean;
}
export interface RedPill {

  readonly makesYouExitTheMatrix?: boolean;
}
export class Morpheus {
  public static isBlue(pill: BluePill | RedPill): pill is BluePill {
    const keys = new Set(Object.keys(pill));
    switch (keys.size) {
      case 1:
        return keys.has('offeredTo');
      case 2:
      return keys.has('offeredTo') && keys.has('makesYouForgetTheMatrix');
      default:

}
export class Neo {
  public readonly tookBlue: boolean;
  public readonly tookRed: boolean;

  public constructor(public readonly pill: BluePill | RedPill) {
    this.tookBlue = pill.offeredTo == 'Neo' && Morpheus.isBlue(pill);
    this.tookRed = pill.offeredTo == 'Neo' && Morpheus.isRed(pill);
  }
}

// WHEN
const bluePillA = new Neo({ offeredTo: 'not Neo' });
const bluePillB = new Neo({ offeredTo: 'Neo', makesYouForgetTheMatrix: true });
const redPillA = new Neo({ offeredTo: 'not Neo' });
const redPillB = new Neo({ offeredTo: 'Neo', makesYouExitTheMatrix: true });

// THEN
expect(bluePillA.pill instanceof BluePill).toBeTruthy();
expect(bluePillA.tookBlue).toBeFalsy();
expect(bluePillA.tookRed).toBeFalsy();

expect(bluePillB.pill instanceof BluePill).toBeTruthy();
expect(bluePillA.tookBlue).toBeTruthy();
expect(bluePillA.tookRed).toBeFalsy();

expect(redPillB.pill instanceof RedPill).toBeTruthy();
expect(bluePillA.tookBlue).toBeFalsy();
expect(bluePillA.tookRed).toBeTruthy();

#### Partially initialized object consumption
When a constructor passes `this` out from **JavaScript** to the *host* app, the
reference must be correctly identified and passed across.

> :construction: The .NET Runtime does not currently honor object identity,
> meaning that despite the same object reference is returned twice, two distinct
> proxies exist for it in the *host* .NET app.
>
> Generally speaking, using pure object identity on *jsii* language front-ends
> is dangerous, as certain statically typed language will require the runtime to
> have different instances for different static types a given object reference
> is surfaced as. It may be necessary to introduce a helper akin to
> `Jsii.isSameObject(a, b)` to enable identity predicates to be used. Other
> helper functions may be necessary, too, such as one to obtain a "consistent"
> object hash for instances in Java (so they can be safely used with `HashMap`,
> ...).

### Interfaces
Tests in this section ensure correct behavior of *behavioral interfaces*.

#### Host app can implement an interface "from scratch"
It is possible for a "pure" host interface implementation to be passed across
the language boundary, it's methods and properties can be used by **JavaScript**
code within the Kernel process.

> :construction: The .NET Runtime currently requires that pure interfaces
> implementations extend from `Amazon.JSII.Rutime.Deputy.DepytyBase`.

> :construction: The Python Runtime currently expects a somewhat un-pythonic way
> to implement interfaces, which requires decorating the implementing class with
> `@jsii.implements("implemented-type.JsiiInterfaceFQN")`.

### Structs & Keyword Arguments

#### Ambiguous arguments are handled correctly
When a method accepts both a positional parameter named `foo` and a struct
parameter with a property named `foo`, the respective values are passed in the
correct parameter location when calling into the **JavaScript** code.

##### Reference Implementation
```ts
// GIVEN
export interface StructType {
  readonly foo: string;
}
export class ClassType {
  public constructor(
    public readonly foo: number,
    public readonly opts: StructType,
  ) {}
}

// WHEN
var result = new ClassType('Bazinga!', { foo: 1337 });

// THEN
expect(typeof result.foo).toBe(1337);
expect(typeof result.opts.foo).toBe('Bazinga!');

### Collections
Tests in this section ensure correct behavior of collections (`List` and `Map`).

#### Struct elements of `List` are deserialized to the correct apparent type
When the declared element type of a `List` is a *struct*, the resulting list
must contain elements of the correct static type. This is a requirement for
statically typed languages such as Java where type parameters are reified.

export interface StructType {
  readonly property: string;

  }
}

// WHEN
