# Configuration

The configuration for `jsii` is recoded in the `package.json` file, which is
the standard package manifest for NPM packages. This document describes the
constraints and extensions `jsii` adds to the [package.json schema].

[package.json schema]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json

## Additional Requirements & Extensions

In order to be able to generate valid packages for all the supported target
package managers, certain fields that are optional in the standard
[package.json schema] are required by `jsii`.

For example, Maven Central requires packages to carry [sufficient metadata],
such as *developer information* and *license*, in order to be valid for
publishing.

Field       | Required | Extensions
------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------
`author`    | Required | `author.organization`
`license`   | Required |
`main`      | Required |
`repository`| Required |
`stability` |          | The field itself is an extension
`types`     | Required |

### Attribution & Licensing

* The [`author`][npm-author] field must be set. Although the string form
  (`"The Octocat <octocat@github.com> (https://github.com/octocat)"`) works,
  it is recommended to set the value using the `object` format:
  ```js
  {
    // ...
    "author": {
      "name": "The Octocat",                // Required
      "email": "octocat@github.com",        // Optional
      "url": "https://github.com/octocat",  // Optional
      "organization": false                 // Optional (defaults to false)
    },
    // ...
  }
  ```
  The `organization` field is an extention from the [package.json schema] that
  can be used to signal the `author` field refers to an `organization` and not
  and individual person.
* The [`license`][npm-license] field must be set to a valid [SPDX license id].
  If you do not intend to release your package for third party consumption,
  `UNLICENSED` (not to be confused with `Unlicense`) is a valid option.

[npm-author]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors
[npm-license]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#license
[SPDX license id]: https://spdx.org/licenses/

### Source Control Information

The [`repository`][npm-repository] field must be set to the URL of the
source-control system (such as a `git` repository) for the package. The
recommended way to provide the value is using the `object` representation:
```js
{
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/aws/jsii.git", // Required
    "type": "git",                            // Recommended
    "directory": "/path"                      // Optional
  }
}
```

### Library Entry Point

Both the [`main`][npm-main] field must be set to the `.js` file that acts as the
entry point of your library (what node's `require('library-name')` will load).
Additionally, `TypeScript`'s [`types`][ts-types] field must be set to the
`.d.ts` file corresponding to the `main` file. The assembly emitted by `jsii`
will only represent types that are exported from the `types` file.

[npm-main]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#main
[ts-types]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html#including-declarations-in-your-npm-package

### Package-level API Stability

The [`.jsii` assembly document](./assembly.md) allows representing API stability
levels on individual API elements. The default value set for API elements for
which a stability declaration is not found can be configured using the
`stability` field of the `package.json` file. It can be set to one of the
following values: `experimental`, `stable`, `deprecated` and `external`. While
the exact semantic value of those fields is defined by the package maintainer,
the generic interepretation for those on packages is:

* `experimental` - the package is not yet ready for production usage, as it is
  still in the early stages if it's development.
* `stable` - the package is ready for production and it's APIs should be
  expected to adhere to [semantic versioning].
* `deprecated` - the package should no longer be used and may no longer be
  maintained. It is a good practice to set the `deprecated` field in
  `packgae.json` with an explanation of how consumers of the package should
  update their dependencies.
* `external` - the package includes APIs that are derived from external
  artifacts, and the owners of those artifacts control their stability.


## The `jsii` section

In order to configure the behavior of `jsii`, the `package.json` file must
include a `jsii` section that can contain the following entries:

Field              | Type       | Required | Default
-------------------|------------|----------|------------------------------------
`excludeTypescript`|`string[]`  |          | *none*
`metadata`         |`object`    |          | *none*
`projectReferences`|`boolean`   |          | `true`
`targets`          |`object`    | Required |
`tsc`              |`object`    |          | `{ outDir: '.', rootDir: '.' }`
`versionFormat`    |`short|full`|          | `full`

### `excludeTypescript`

By default, `jsii` will include _all_ `*.ts` files (except `.d.ts` files) in the
`TypeScript` compier input. This can be problematic for example when the
package's build or test procedure generates `.ts` files that cannot be compiled
with `jsii`'s compiler settings.

The `excludeTypescript` configuration accepts a list of glob patterns. Files
matching any of those patterns will be excluded from the `TypeScript` compiler
input.

### `metadata`

The `metadata` section can be used to record additional metadata as key-value
pairs that will be recorded as-is into the `.jsii` assembly file. That metadata
can later be inspected using [`jsii-reflect`](../packages/jsii-reflect)
utilities, for example.

### `targets`

The `targets` section is where `jsii` packages define which target languages
they support. This provides the package generators with the additional
information they require in order to name generated artifacts. Configuration is
provided as a mapping from target name to a configuration object.

#### Configuring `Python`

The `python` target requires two configuration entries:
* `module` - the name of the generated **Python** module, which will be used by
  users in `import` directives.
* `distName` - the [PyPI] distribution name for the package.

Example:
```js
{
  "jsii": {
    "targets": {
      "python": {
        "module": "hello_jsii",   // Required
        "distName": "hello-jsii"  // Required
      },
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

The resulting package can be published to [PyPI].

[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/

#### Configuring `Java`

The `java` target requires the following configuration:
* `maven` - the `groupId` and `artifactId` for the **Maven** package.
  + Optionally a `versionSuffix` can be provided that will be appended at the
    end of the **Maven** package's `version` field. The suffix must start with
    a `.` or a `-`.
* `package` - the root **Java** package name under which the types will be
  declared.

Example:
```js
{
  "jsii": {
    "java": {
      "package": "acme.jsii.hello",   // Required
      "maven": {
        "groupId": "acme",            // Required
        "artifactId": "jsii-hello",   // Required
        "versionSuffix": ".PREVIEW"   // Optional
      }
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

The resulting artifact is a **Maven** package that can be deployed to
[Maven Central] using the `deploy-staged-repository` command of the
[nexus-staging-maven-plugin].

[Maven Centra]: https://search.maven.org
[nexus-staging-maven-plugin]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.sonatype.plugins/nexus-staging-maven-plugin

#### Configuring `.NET`

The `dotnet` target requires the following configuration:
* `namespace` - the root namespace under which types will be declared.
* `packageId` - the identified of the package in the NuGet registry.
* `versionSuffix` - an optional suffix that will be appended at the end of the
  NuGet package's `version` field. The suffix must start with a `-`.
* `signAssembly` - whether the assembly should be strong-name signed. Defaults
  to `false` when not specified.
* `assemblyOriginatorKeyFile`- the path to the strong-name signing key to be
  used. When not specified or if the file referred to does not exist, the
  assembly will not be strong-name signed.

Example:
```js
{
  "jsii": {
    "dotnet": {
      "namespace": "Acme.HelloJsii",            // Required
      "packageId": "Acme.HelloJsii",            // Required
      "signAssembly": true,                     // Optional
      "assemblyOriginatorKeyFile": "./key.snk", // Optional
      "versionSuffix": "-preview"               // Optional
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

The resulting artifact is a NuGet package that can be published to [NuGet] using
the standard [`nuget push`][nuget-push] command.

[nuget-push]: https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/nuget/nuget-org/publish-a-package

### `tsc`

In order to the generated `javascript` can be properly loaded by the `jsii`
runtimes, `jsii` generates a [`tsconfig.json`] file with fixed settings at the
beginning of the compilation pass. Certain configuration options can however
be set by the maintainers in order to better suit their development workflow
or processes. Those configuration are set in the `jsii.tsc` section of the
`package.json` file, but use the same name as [`tsconfig.json`]:

* `outDir` - path to the directory when artifacts generated by the `TypeScript`
  compiler will be placed.
  * This influences the location of `.d.ts` and `.js` files, but will not affect
    the location of the `.jsii` file, which will _always_ be placed at the
    package's root.
* `rootDir` - specifies the root directory that contains all of the `.ts` source
  files. This is used in conjunction with `outDir`, to control the directory
  structure that gets generated.

Refer to the [TypeScript compiler options reference][ts-options] for more
information about those options.

[`tsconfig.json`]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html
[ts-options]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html

### `versionFormat`

Determines the format of the `jsii` toolchain version string that will be
included in the `.jsii` assembly file's `jsiiVersion` attribute.

* `full` (the default) - a version number including a commit hash will be used
  * For example: `0.14.3 (build 1b1062d)`
* `short` - only the version number of `jsii` will be used
  * For example: `0.14.3`

This option is primarily useful for developing regression tests when developing
`jsii` itself, as using the `short` format reduces volatility in the assemblies
generated by development versions of `jsii`. Users of `jsii` are advised to
leave the default setting, as having full version information can be essential
when trying to troubleshoot assembly generation problems.

## Dependency considerations

Like any node library, `jsii` packages can declare runtime dependencies using
the [`dependencies`][npm-reps] section of `package.json`.

[npm-deps]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies

### Dependencies that are `jsii` modules

Node modules are conventionally versionned using [semantic versioning], but that
is not true of all package managers that `jsii` is able to target. Additionally,
only one version of the `jsii` runtime and kernel can be used within a given
application. In order to avoid version resolution surprises at run-time, `jsii`
requires duplicating `jsii` modules declarations from [`dependencies`][npm-deps]
into the [`peerDependencies`][npm-peer-deps] section.

[npm-peer-deps]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies
[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org

### Dependencies that are not `jsii` modules

The `jsii` runtimes in non-**javascript** languages do not use `npm install`,
and as a consequence cannot rely on `npm install` bringing in a package's
dependecies. As a consequence, dependencies that are not themselves `jsii`
modules, __must__ also be referenced in the [`bundledDependencies`][npm-bundled]
section, so that they are bundled within the NPM package.
