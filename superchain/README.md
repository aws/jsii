A [`debian`][debian]-based Docker image bundling all the SDKs and tools
required in order to package [jsii] projects in all supported languages.

## Recommended image

We recommend the following image for most users.
See [Image tags](#image-tags) for further details.

```

```

| `OpenJDK 20` | Amazon Corretto `>= 20.0.2`              |
| `.NET SDK`   | `>= 6.0.14`                              |
| `mono`       | `>= 6.12.0.200`                          |
| `Javascript` | see [NodeJS and NPM](#nodejs-and-npm)    |
| `PowerShell` | `pwsh >= 7.2.16`                         |

## Image tags

Maintained image tags are named using the following pattern:

```
public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:<JSII-MAJOR>-<BASE>(-node<NODE-MAJOR>)(-nightly)
```

- `<JSII-MAJOR>` is the major line of the jsii toolchain (must be `1`)
- `<BASE>` is the base image tag, currently supported base images are
  - `bookworm-slim`
  - `bullseye-slim`
- `<NODE-MAJOR>` is the major version of node contained in the image
  - `18` corresponds to node 18.x, this is the default
  - `20` corresponds to node 20.x
- `-nightly` images are released from the `HEAD` of the [`aws/jsii`][jsii]
  repository and should typically not be used for production workloads

**The following base image lines have been deprecated and are not updated anymore. Users are adviced to upgrade to :**

- `:1-buster-slim-*`

**The previous image tags have been discontinued and must NOT BE USED ANYMORE:**

- `:latest` (users should migrate to `:1-bullseye-slim`)
- `:nightly` (users should migrate to `:1-bullseye-slim-nightly`)
- `:nodeX` (users should migrate to an image using a supported node version)
- `:nodeX-nightly` (users should migrate to a nightly image using a supported node version)

## Building

This docker image must be built from the package root with the Dockerfile set to
`superchain/Dockerfile`:

```
jsii$ docker build . -f superchain/Dockerfile -t jsii/superchain:local
```

In case the tests fail, skip the tests and inspect the image manually:

```
jsii$ docker build . -f superchain/Dockerfile -t jsii/superchain:local --target=superchain
```

## NodeJS and NPM

We build multiple versions of this image, for different versions of Node.
You can use a specific Node version like this:

```
public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:1-bullseye-slim-node20
```

We will stop publishing images for Node versions that are EOL.

| Debian                      | Node versions    |
| ----------------------------| -----------------|
| `bookworm-slim`             | `20`             |
| `bullseye-slim`             | `20`, `18`       |
| `buster-slim` (deprecated)  | `18`, `16`, `14` | 

If you are building this image from source, you can control the Node version with the
`NODE_MAJOR_VERSION` build argument:

```
jsii$ docker build [...] --build-arg NODE_MAJOR_VERSION=16
```

## Python

The image includes the most recent Python version available for the respecitve Debian distribution.
A complete list can be viewed on the [Debian website](https://wiki.debian.org/Python#Supported_Python_Versions).

| Debian                      | Python version |
| ----------------------------| ---------------|
| `bookworm-slim`             | `3.11`         |
