# Superchain

A [`debian`][debian]-based Docker image bundling all the SDKs and tools
required in order to package [jsii] projects in all supported languages.

[debian]: https://gallery.ecr.aws/debian/debian
[jsii]: https://github.com/aws/jsii

## Included Language SDKs

| SDK          | Version                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `OpenJDK 20` | Amazon Corretto `>= 20.0.0`              |
| `.NET SDK`   | `>= 6.0.14`                              |
| `mono`       | `>= 6.8.0.105`                           |
| `Javascript` | see [NodeJS and NPM](#nodejs-and-npm)    |
| `PowerShell` | `pwsh >= 7.1.3`                          |
| `Python 3`   | `python3 >= 3.7.4` with `pip3 >= 20.0.2` |

## Image tags

Maintained image tags are named using the following pattern:

```
public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:<JSII-MAJOR>-<BASE>(-node<NODE-MAJOR>)(-nightly)
```

- `<JSII-MAJOR>` is the major line of the jsii toolchain
  - The only supported value is `1`
- `<BASE>` is the base image tag (e.g: `buster-slim`, `bullseye-slim`, `bookworm-slim`)
  - The only supported value is `buster-slim`
- `<NODE-MAJOR>` is the major version of node contained in the image
  - `18` corresponds to node 18.x, this is the default
  - `20` corresponds to node 20.x
- `-nightly` images are released from the `HEAD` of the [`aws/jsii`][jsii]
  repository and should typically not be used for production workloads

The previous image tags have been discontinued:

- `:latest` (users should migrate to `:1-buster-slim`)
- `:nightly` (users should migrate to `:1-buster-slim-nightly`)
- `:node10` (users should migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18`)
- `:node10-nightly` (users should migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18-nightly`)
- `:node12` (users should migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18`)
- `:node12-nightly` (users shoudl migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18-nightly`)
- `:node14` (users should migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18`)
- `:node14-nightly` (users shoudl migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18-nightly`)
- `:node16` (users should migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18`)
- `:node16-nightly` (users shoudl migrate to `:1-buster-slim-node18-nightly`)

## Building

This docker image must be built from the package root with the Dockerfile set to
`superchain/Dockerfile`:

```
jsii$ docker build . -f superchain/Dockerfile -t jsii/superchain:local
```

In case the tests fail, skip the tests and inspect the image manually:

```
jsii$ docker build . -f superchain/Dockerfile -t jsii/superchain:local --target=superchain
```

## NodeJS and NPM

We build multiple versions of this image, for different versions of Node. They are available as:

* `public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:1-buster-slim-node14(-nightly)`
* `public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:1-buster-slim-node16(-nightly)`
* `public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:1-buster-slim-node18(-nightly)`
* `public.ecr.aws/jsii/superchain:1-buster-slim-node20(-nightly)`

If you are building this image from source, you can control the Node version with the
`NODE_MAJOR_VERSION` build argument:

```
jsii$ docker build [...] --build-arg NODE_MAJOR_VERSION=16
```
